code runner based on judge0 api

wip

todo:
- [ ] full language support, judge0 already supports 70+ languages, so I just need to implement the drop down and id system.
- [ ] better error handling, i dont even know how i handle error right now lmfao
- [ ] stdin seems like not working?
- [ ] more lsp support, only python works for now. 
- [ ] styling. buttons dropdowns are straight unconfigured bootstrap lmfao
